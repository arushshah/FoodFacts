FoodFacts
=========

LocalHackDay Fall 2014 Project

We realized that health conscience has become a huge concept in the United States in the past few years. We predicted that people need a easy and quick way to search up nutritional facts about what they are eating. Many restaurants do not include the composition of their food, so consumers have no idea what and how much they are consuming. FoodFacts is a simple, yet very useful web application that has one sole purpose: to give nutritional information about common foods served in restaurants. We are proud of the infinite amount of items that can be added to our database and our convenient search option.
